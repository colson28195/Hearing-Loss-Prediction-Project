## Project Title
The Use of Machine Learning in Wideband Absorbance Data

## Aim
The aim of the project is to apply machine learning methods in understanding, interpreting and classifying wideband absorbance data, to automatically diagnose ears as normal or with conductive conditions. In addition, the machine learning tools will be compared to the current method, receiver characteristics analysis.

## Background & Value Proposition
-	Discuss conventional tympanometry and WBA to provide more context to the project (research is required)
-	Discuss the current method in classifying WBA data
-	How ML tools are an improvement from ROC
-	Challenges may be faced

## Deliverables & Timeline
An automated machine learning tool that can use WBA data to diagnose ears as normal or with conductive conditions
Features and advantages about the ML tool
## Methods
Using machine learning methods to improve classification accuracy and output.
Various algorithms will be used, such as:
- Decision Tree
	Definition
	Describe the modelling process in a non-technical way

- Random Forest
	Definition
	Describe the modelling process in a non-technical way

- Logistic Regression
	Definition
	Describe the modelling process in a non-technical way

- Support Vector Machine
	Definition
	Describe the modelling process in a non-technical way


Run different models and compare results, choose the model with the highest accuracy to diagnose ears.


## Project Management Timeline & Costs
GANTT chart needed for the team – need to decide whether we will use Excel or other automated GANTT chart platform
The GANTT organises the progress of the project, including team meetings, client meetings, tasks and deadlines.
Costs – estimation of manpower and salaries to maintain and update the ML tool.

## Appendix
To be completed by individuals.
