## Background 
Understanding the data 
- where was data collected (university audiology laboratory, Brisbane) 
- how many ears studied (with & without OME)
- tests performed : PTA (226Hz), WBT (226Hz to 8000Hz) / Pressure
- feature columns including gender (male & female), age range, ethinicity
- target column class to predict middle ear health

Current data interpretation practice
- ROC curve is used to analyze the diagnostic value of WBT
- Metrics used Sensitivity & Specificity (preferred)
- ROC graphs
- Sensitivity & Specificity table

## Value Proposition
Why use data science
- limited understanding and interpretation of WBT data
- studying ROC curve tedious process for multiple frequencies

Understanding bottleneck/challenges in clientâ€™s data interpretation
- statistical tests performance and understanding?
- expert knowledge

Have a clear value proposition (efficiency, consistency/reproduciblity, cost-saving etc)
- ML classification tool to support clinical diagnosis
- current best score
- can this tool be repurposed for other data like WBA?
- risk assessment (low risk and high reward)

## Deliverables 
1. A machine learning tool that can use WBA data to diagnose ears as normal or with conductive conditions. The key features of the tools will be
- Highly interactive user inferface which allows selection of a ML methods from a curated set of algorithms to evaluate the ear data 
- Better visualization of the output metrics for improveed interpretability 
- Comparing the result of differet ML methods and choosing the ideal method to diagnose the ear

2. Code repository hosted on Github, which can be utilised for future development purposes
3. Final Report that summaries the data characteristics and methods used in the tool



## Methods
Preliminary interrogation of the data

Choice of different data exploration and analytical techniques
- logistic regression
- decision tree
- random forest
- svm

How to make the process understandable and the output usable (e.g. parameter control, incorporating domain knowledge, communicating output uncertainty)
- feature selection
- metrics

Visualisation to communicate the processes/results
