## Background
Understanding the data
- where was data collected (university audiology laboratory, Brisbane)
- how many ears studied (with & without OME)
- tests performed : PTA (226Hz), WBT (226Hz to 8000Hz) / Pressure
- feature columns including gender (male & female), age range, ethinicity
- target column class to predict middle ear health

Current data interpretation practice
- ROC curve is used to analyze the diagnostic value of WBT
- Metrics used Sensitivity & Specificity (preferred)
- ROC graphs
- Sensitivity & Specificity table

## Value Proposition
Why use data science
- limited understanding and interpretation of WBT data
- studying ROC curve tedious process for multiple frequencies

Understanding bottleneck/challenges in clientâ€™s data interpretation
- statistical tests performance and understanding?
- expert knowledge

Have a clear value proposition (efficiency, consistency/reproduciblity, cost-saving etc)
- ML classification tool to support clinical diagnosis
- current best score
- can this tool be repurposed for other data like WBA?
- risk assessment (low risk and high reward)

## Deliverables
Expected outcomes of the project
- comparision of various classification algorithms based on metrics

Data analytics & visualisation outputs in presentation, reports and codes
- a software tool?

## Methods
Preliminary interrogation of the data

Choice of different data exploration and analytical techniques
- logistic regression
- decision tree
- random forest
- svm

How to make the process understandable and the output usable (e.g. parameter control, incorporating domain knowledge, communicating output uncertainty)
- feature selection
- loss functions

Visualisation to communicate the processes/results
