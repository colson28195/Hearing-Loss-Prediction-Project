## Project Title
The Use of Machine Learning in Wideband Tympanometry Data

## Aim
The aim of the project is to apply machine learning methods in understanding, interpreting and classifying wideband tympanometry data, to automatically diagnose ears as normal or with conductive conditions. In addition, the performance of machine learning tools will be compared to the current method, receiver characteristics analysis, to examine whether machine learning tools are better suited to wideband tympanometry.

Applying apply machine learning algorithms to analyse, interpret and classify wideband absorbance data(WBA), and diagnose the condition of the ears as normal or with conductive conditions. Moreover, a comparison will also be drawn between the numerous ML algorithms that will be run and their performance will also be tested against the current method being used which is ROC.
## Background
Wideband Tympanometry technology (WBT) is a useful tool used to assess the middle ear function at different frequencies and pressure levels. The middle ear function plays a critical role for hearing, where it transfers the vibration of eardrum into waves in the fluid and membranes of the inner ear. Thus, it is important to accurately detect whether patients’ have conductive conditions, and now WBT is helping to test the middle ear function. WBT provides resonant frequency of the middle ear and can test frequencies from variance frequency range and pressure, which improves from the conventional tympanometry using only low-single frequency. Despite WBT has been available for almost two decades, clinics do not have wide use of it due to the limited interpretation of results. Traditionally, receiver characteristics analysis is used to interpret WBT data and specificity is preferred in analysing the ROC curve. However, the interpretation of ROC curve can be tedious and difficult to interpret, which is why many clinics have not been able to incorporate WBT. Thus, machine learning tools are proposed to analyse WBT with better accuracy and produce results that are easily interpretable.

This proposal addresses the limitation of current method used on WBT and proposes machine learning tools. The WBT data includes tests on frequencies from 250Hz to 8000Hz, which is currently analysed and modelled using ROC curve. The ROC curve is tedious to analyse and involves lots of manual labelling and comparisons, which is not the best tool in a busy clinical environment. Therefore, machine learning classifiers will help to resolve this problem by automatically detecting abnormal ear conditions with improved accuracy. This can help clinics to better incorporate WBT in diagnose patients and reduce time in detecting abnormal conditions. Furthermore, machine learning tools are robust with pre-processing of WBT data and feature extraction, which will be able to take more data in the future and improve clinical efficiency.

## Value proposition
Machine learning is a powerful tool in analysing patterns, learning and making predictions. With a well-trained machine learning algorithm, it can improve the analysis of WBT data and better detect ears with conductive conditions. Here are the key benefits:
1. Improve the accuracy in detecting ears with conductive conditions. The highest accuracy rate from the current method, receiver characteristics analysis, is only 74%. Machine learning classifiers will be trained and compared to find the most accurate one.

2. ncrease reproducibility of the machine learning algorithm and interpretability of the results. Once the machine learning classifier is trained, future data can be fed in easily and results will be produced instantly.  This will save time and human capital in clinics as well as help to transform raw data to meaningful insights about patients’ ear condition.

3. Machine learning tools will be able to help clinic practitioners interpret patients test results quickly and more accurately, which improves efficiency and reduces cost. In addition, machine learning tools can be applied to other data easily, such as WBA data.
