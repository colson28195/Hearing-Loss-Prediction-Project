## Project Title
The Use of Machine Learning in Wideband Absorbance Data

AIM & BACKGROUND & VALUE PROPOSITIONS
Get more insights by people who attended the meeting to discuss keywords and terms to be used and give a general idea of the aim.

Applying apply machine learning algorithms to analyse, interpret and classify wideband absorbance data(WBA), and diagnose the condition of the ears as normal or with conductive conditions. Moreover, a comparison will also be drawn between the numerous ML algorithms that will be run and their performance will also be tested against the current method being used which is ROC.

DELIVERABLES & TIMELINE
Get more insights by people who attended the meeting and what was agreed upon

-	Discuss conventional tympanometry and WBA to provide more context to the project (research is required)
-	Discuss the current method in classifying WBA data
-	How ML tools are an improvement from ROC
-	Challenges may be faced

An automated machine learning tool that can use WBA data to diagnose ears as normal or with conductive conditions
Features and advantages about the ML tool

METHODS
Assumptions that we are making.
What sort of preprocessing we are doing and why.

Describe the methods we shall be using and why - 
1.SVM - This method creates an augmented line to classify 
Disadvantages -
Computationally expensive
Advantages - 
Better Prediction
Flexibility in choosing the methods to apply prediction function

2.Decisison Tree - Performs classification based on a series of situations in descending order of attribute hierarchy which is 
derived using mathematical equations.
Disadvantages - 
Time complexity increases
Advantages -
Highly accurate in prediction
Helps in containing the error rate(more transparent to evaluate best variables)

3.Random Forrest - Multiple Decision trees run one after another, each time increasing the accuracy by learning from the previous trees.
Disadvantages - 
Time complexity is worse than than a decision tree
Advantages - 
Improves accuracy with each iteration of decision trees

4.Logistic Regression - Uses odds ratio to classify outcomes. 
Disadvantages - 
Accuracy is not that high when compared to other models
Advantages -
Simple to implement 
Less computationally expensive
Usually works best when there 

Run different models and compare results, choose the model with the highest accuracy to diagnose hearing issues

PROJECT MANAGEMENT TIMELINE & COSTS
Need to discuss how to articulate

INDIVIDUAL REFLECTION & PLAN
Need to be done by everybody




Run different models and compare results, choose the model with the highest accuracy to diagnose ears.


## Project Management Timeline & Costs
GANTT chart needed for the team – need to decide whether we will use Excel or other automated GANTT chart platform
The GANTT organises the progress of the project, including team meetings, client meetings, tasks and deadlines.
Costs – estimation of manpower and salaries to maintain and update the ML tool.

## Appendix
To be completed by individuals.
