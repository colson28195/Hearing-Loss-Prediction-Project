### Agenda:

- Questions to ask Robyn:
Is there a data dictionary? What do the columns mean?
How was the data collected?
What does each row represent?
What is the target?

### Minutes:

Wide-Band Absorbance/Immittence
- Multi-frequency 250-8000 hz
- Old us pressurise ear canal and 226 hz
- WDA done at ambient pressure, us on variable pressure
- Equal pressure in head and ear canal side (TPP) - energy being absorved at that pressure
- old is moutnain, road or skewed mountain
- low absorbance means bad
- delivers clicks and pressures to the middle ear
- PQ = Parent Questionnaire
- PTA = Pur Tone Audiology (0-110) -> Pass/Fail
- ECV, TPP, SC -> traditional -> only A is pass (0)
- OAE - objective measure of hearing
- Match TPP (AdultAbsorbance) to Pressure for equlibrium
- Does not match exactly for all patients
- Currenly use ROC curve
- Prefer Sensitivity over Specificity
- Otitis Media - inflammationj of middle ear
- 20 db is normal
- 0 no energy, 1 all energy is being absorbed -> high is better
